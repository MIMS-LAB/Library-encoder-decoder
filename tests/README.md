# Tests

These test modules are used to send mock data over a connection. 
The automated tests will only run on windows at the moment.

You need virtual COM ports to run the tests, I suggest installing 
[VSPD](https://cdn.eltima.com/download/vspd.exe).

Make sure to check the paths set for decoder and `test.c` locations
in the `test.py` file.
